LDS General Conference plugin for XBMC
=============

With this pluging you can watch LDS [general conferences](http://www.lds.org/general-conference) which have been released on [lds.org](http://www.lds.org) website using [XBMC](http://xbmc.org/) program. 

You can now watch older conferences also. In some of the conferences only some of the sessions are available in video formats (so only sessions with talks are shown in the lists). 

If you see something you'd like to have in this plugin. Let me know what it is and I'll see if I can include it.

This is **not** an official plugin by [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons)](http://lds.org).

Options
-------
There is few options you can choose using the XMBC's plugin option menu.

*Video Quality* can be chosen from the three qualities available on the web site (360p, 720p and 1080p). Videos are streamed streight from the server so choose well based on you conection speed or you'll end up buffering from a loong time. If no video with wanted format found then fallsback and tryes to use the one that is found (this is the case with some of the older conferences)

*Video Language* at the moment only finnish and english are supported, but if you'd like to get it on any other language available available on general conferences webpage let me know (add an issue) and I'll add it.
